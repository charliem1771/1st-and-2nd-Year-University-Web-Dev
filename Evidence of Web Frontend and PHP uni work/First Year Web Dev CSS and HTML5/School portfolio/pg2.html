			<h2><strong>Programming</strong></h2>
				<p>
					Throughout the programming unit at MMU you are taught how to write code primarily in Java, using the IDE's eclipse and processing.
					The course is designed to serve as a introduction to programming and train you to properly utilise the most important tools in software
					engineering. Even though the course is very informative It has been more of a referesher then anything else so far, which has primarily imporved my logical thinking. 
					This is because I have had a lot of expierence writing code before I came to MMU, I believe my expierence working at Lucid-Games
					on professional standard code for video games will help me a lot throughout this unit. So far I would say I am doing quite well in the progr
					aming unit and I am aiming for the highest possible grade on the upcoming MCQ test.

			<h2><strong>Web-Development</strong></h2>
				<p>
					Throughout the Web-Development unit you learn about CSS3,HTML5,Javascript and PHP and you are taught the basics of front 
					back end Web-Development. So far in the unit we have been taught about CSS and HTML5 along with how to use them for responsive
					and accessible websites. In the past I have created websites using HTML5 and CSS3 and I believe that has helped. I believe so 
					far I am doing Ok in the Unit and I am striving for a high grade on the first assignment.
