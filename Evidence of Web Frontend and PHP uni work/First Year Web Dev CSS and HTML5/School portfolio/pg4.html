				<h2><strong>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</strong></h2>
					<p>
						As a Software Engineering student and someone who has written computer code for many years It has helped me 
						sharpen my probelm solving skills. Along with working for some time  which has helped me improve my critical
						thinking and helped me think on my feet. I would say overall I have good critical thinking and problem solving
						skills in a professional environment.
					</p>
					<h2><strong>Professionalism</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Over my years learning about computer technology and the computing industry I have been to many professional events
						where I have had to meet and network with industry professionals. Along with this I have been to many interviews
						for programming jobs and secured a internship in the sector for some time. Due to all of this I believe when necessary
						I can be very professional.

			<h2><strong>Professionalism<strong/></h2>
					<p>
						My communication skills are relatively well developed due to having worked for such a long period of time this has helped
						develop my communication skills in a work based envrionment. Yet I would say they could use some work and be more clear to some
						extent.
					</p>
					<h2><strong>Leadership<strong/></h2>
					<p>
						I have led teams before which has helped me develop some leadership skills I have also worked in teams at work and in school over the
						years. All of this has allowed me to develop some level of teamwork skills yet I do believe these skills could be developed further espically
						in the area of leadership. Since I will admit this area is lacking and requires imporvement more then most.

			<h2><strong>Evaluation and  Research skills<strong/></h2>
				<p>
					Throughout my school life I have often had to reserahc topics and extract and evaluate information from them about them. This is a skill which
					I have had to use on many a occasion while completing assignments and writing essays along with doing courseowrk. Yet It is a skill which I do believe could
					be further developed to a more professional extent and one I would like to have more evidence for.
