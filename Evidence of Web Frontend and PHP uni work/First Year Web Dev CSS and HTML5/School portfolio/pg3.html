			<h2><strong>Computer Systems fundamentals</strong></h2>
				<p>
					Throughout the Computer System Fundamentals Unit or CSF you learn about discrete mathematics boolean algebra and assembly
					langauge programming. So far we have covered the algebra of sets and boolean algebra, I have very little expierenc in this area
					I would say it is my weak point. I am aiming to pass the upcoming CSF logic test to the best my ability, yet I do have doubts
					of how capable I am.

			<h2><strong>Information Systems</strong></h2>
				<p>	
					Throughpout the information systems unit we cover database design and management the sofwtare developmnent lifecycle and query
					langauges eg SQL. Even though I have had very little expierence in this are previously I am very confident that my group performed
					well in the initial assignment and as I normally do I am striving for the best grade I can achieve in this assignment.</p>
